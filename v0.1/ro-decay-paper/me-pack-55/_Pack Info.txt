Description: 

It is increasingly common to combine Microarray and Quantitative Trait Loci data to aid the search for candidate genes responsible for phenotypic variation. Workflows provide a means of systematically processing large datasets, and represent a framework for the re-use and the explicit declaration of experimental methods. In this pack is a paper which describes the issues facing the manual analysis of microarray and QTL data for the discovery of candidate genes underlying complex phenotypes. Our methodology was applied to a use case of resistance to African trypanosomiasis in the mouse. Workflows developed in this investigation, including a guide to loading and executing them with example data, are available within this pack.
Supplimentary information is provided in this pack.
