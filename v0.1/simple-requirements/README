Simple RO sample based on single-step "workflow" used in Wf4Ever requirements work

In this example, the "workflow" is in the form of a shell script, mkjson.sh,
which converts ODS spreadsheet data into JSON data for subsequent processing by Dexy.

The example is used for a completeness evaluation driven from a wfdesc description
of the workflow.

The simple-requirements-wfdesc.rdf file is (will be) the workflow description.
The simple-requirements-minim.rdf file is (will be) the minimum requirement description for 
completeness of the workflow-based results.

(Original build instructions)

To build requirements documents from ODS spreadsheets:

  $ cd ${wf4ever-requirements}/docs
  $ ./mkjson.sh
  $ dexy --utf8
