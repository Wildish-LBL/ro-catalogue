When working with Live Objects, the platform should allow the users to choose not to backup full versions of the RO when a modification is made in the components (data or processes involved). Because of the big volumes of data involved it may be reasonable not to store multiple versions of the same RO. On the contrary, it may be useful in this case to allow versioning of individual components of a RO, those not suffering of heavy sized issues. For example, automatic versioning of metadata (contributors, access privileges, modification date, etc.) may be implemented to trace the timeline provenance of these metadata. Publication Objects or Archived Objects may depend on external resources that may evolve or being suppressed with time. In this case versioning of these RO may be useful to check their integrity and authenticity."
