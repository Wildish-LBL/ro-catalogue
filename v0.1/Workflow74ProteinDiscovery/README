HI Graham!

Hi Marco!
Marco Roos 14:21 
What is the most urgent thing you would like to have from me (if anything)?
gklyne 14:22 
I think I'd like an example of a single-workflow RO, with provenance and other relevant information, that we can use as a basis for both the provenance query showcase, and also for the Reviewing with ROs showcase...
14:23
I was looking at Kristina's MetS RO, and was wondering if it would make sense to fillet a single workflow from that.
Marco Roos 14:23 
It would be better to have a smaller one, wouldn't it?
gklyne 14:29 
In other strands, I assume you're working with Raul and Pique to forge a consensus around an RO evolution model that makes sense in the context of the reviewing scenario we discussed (which may include reworking the scenario to match or mesh with the model)
14:24
Re. smaller WF, I'm working on one of my own, based on a simple bash script, which can be seen at ...

Workflow 74 is my most used example workflow on myExperiment. I am starting Taverna now to check some workflows.
gklyne 14:25 
It's useful for testing the technology/vocabs, but would be good to have something more genuinely research-based.
14:27
... this one?  http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/74.html
14:28
Do you have a full set of (releasable) data to go with it?
Marco Roos 14:30 
You mean example inputs and outputs?
gklyne 14:30 
Yes - all the stuff that provenance would apply to.
Marco Roos 14:31 
Shall I just run the workflow and save that all?
gklyne 14:31 
Actually, I guess it's justy a query, right?  the rest is external databases.
Marco Roos 14:32 
Indeed, it has example inputs in its input descriptions.
gklyne 14:32 
That would be handy.  Then I can try and build an RO around it 
14:33
(I*'m not familiar with using myExperiment or Taverna, so some of my questions may seem uninformed ... because they are.)
Marco Roos 14:34 
np. I think I just made Taverna stall though (tried to load a workflow that is not public; Taverna did warn me.
14:57
The workflow is running, but is taking longer than I anticipated. Is it ok if I send the results in an hour or so?  I promised to go to a talk at 4pm (CET)
gklyne 14:57 
Yes, of course.  I'm still working on my more synthetic example.

Hi Graham, here are three outputs of the workflow (I ran it with the example input and maximum abstracts=3). Now I have to have a drink with colleagues, some have questions about our project!
gklyne 15:58 
Marco - many thanks for these - I'll use these to try and build an RO structure, and come back to you if I have any questions.
