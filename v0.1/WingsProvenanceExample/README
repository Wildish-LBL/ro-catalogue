There are three key files in this directory that are used to generate the sample RO from the Wings data served by the endpoint at isi.edu.

getWingsData.sh - performs a series of SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries to extract Wings provenance data from the isi.edu endpoint, and convert it to wfdesc/wfprov vocabularies.  (Uses SPARQL CONSTRUCT query as a kind of simple inference rule.)  The resulting RDF data is saved in subdirectory wf34.

prefixes.sparql - a file of common prefixes for SPARQL queries, used by the getWingsData.sh script.

makeresourcelists.sh - is a local helper script that queries the RDF data obtained from Wings (using Jena tools for querying local RDF files) and generates a list of resources of various types.  These lists are used when generating RO manifests by the next script.

make.sh - uses ro-manager to create RO structure for the Wings provenance example data, using data and RDF files generated by the preceding scriots.  (Within the ro-catalogue project, I am using the file make.sh as a convention for the file that actually builds the RO structures.)

NOTE

The wings-query-*.sparql files are all auto-generated by the getWingsData.sh script.
