This directory contains sample input values that can be used to run the workflow,
to demonstrate the idea of minimum information for runnability.

File names are <input port name>.text.

Taverna does not pick up these values automatically, so they must be entered 
by hand when running the workflow, but there presence means that it is possible
to run the workflow.  The actual sample values here are similar to but not 
identical to the ones used for the associated paper, so the results do not
match those in the pack extracted from myExperiment.
